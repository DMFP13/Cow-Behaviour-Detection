## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- **`Cow_Behaviour_Detection_Model`** The model will download a selection of images from google drive and annotate named bounding boxes on the images in reference to behaviour
- **`Directory`**: Key outputs, including images, videos, figures, tables, and other results generated by the notebook through th etraining process.
